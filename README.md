# honk_custom

Custom html page and templates or patches for the
[honk](https://humungus.tedunangst.com/r/honk) federated
ActivityPub server.
These are mainly related to the UX, but patching of the Go files
might happen if I feel the need.

# How to use

Clone or [download](https://git.les-miquelots.net/honk_custom/snapshot/honk_custom-master.zip)
this repository and then copy the contents of the `views` directory on
your honk `views` directory. For patches, I advice you to execute the
following : `man patch`.
